Difficulties with learning SDR as compared to Python (or most other things):

- General challenges:
  - Not widely popular (yet), and therefore less community support
    - Tools tend to be more buggy
    - Not a lot of tutorials available
    - Incomplete docs
  - Can't see the radio waves to know if it's working

- GNU Radio-specific:
  - Steep learning curve; non-obvious order of topics
    - Compare to Python: Output (print), Input (input), storage (variables), etc
    - SDRs: Understanding basic tutorials requires understanding of sample rates, etc
  - Lots of parts that can go wrong without showing an obvious source of the problem
  - Obscure / unclear error messages
