## Receiving

```
          -->  Time Sink (First)
          |
          -->  Waterfall sink
          |
osmocom  --->  OOK Demod  --> Keep after data      --->  Pack K Bits  -->  File Sink
Source                        equals 1 Hier Block   |
                                                    --> UChar to Float  -->  Time Sink
                                                                             (second)
```

Note: You'll need the `Keep after data equals 1 Hier Block` block from [here](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/blob/main/misc/grc_files/keep_after_data_equals_1_hier_block.grc)

Parameters:
- osmocom Source:
  - _use the same parameters as an osmocom source from a previous flowgraph_
- OOK Demod:
  - Symbol Length: `int(1e6)`
  - Threshold: _make a slider between 0 and 1_
- Pack K Bits:
  - K: `8`
- Time Sink (second):
  - Number of Points: `10`
  - Sample Rate: `2`
- File Sink:
  - File: _pick a NON-EXISTENT file_
  - Unbuffered: `on`


At the beginning of your file, make sure you have a character that starts with a 1 in binary.
You can copy paste this one: "ยก"
