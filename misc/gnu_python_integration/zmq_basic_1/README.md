A basic transmitter using "normal" Python to generate the data, and zmq to push it to gnuradio.

Steps to run:

1. Download `zmq_socket_setup_PURE.py` and `qt_block_init_PURE.py` from the [zmq_libraries directory](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/tree/main/topics/gnu_python_integration/zmq_libraries)
2. Open `zmq_pull_GRCGEN.grc` in GNU Radio Companion, and generate the Python file.
