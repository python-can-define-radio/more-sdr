1. Create a folder/directory on your computer storage device.  
   The folder name could be "e320_python_SDR_ctrl", where the "e320" refers to "exercise 320"
2. Download the 3 files "basic_transmitter_GRCGEN.grc", "qt_block_init_PYPURE.py", "control_PYPURE.py" to that folder.
3. Open "basic_transmitter_GRCGEN.grc" in GNU Radio Companion.
   Generate the Python file: from the menu, select "Run -> Generate".
4. Close GNU Radio Companion
5. Run python3 control_PYPURE.py  (Requires an SDR)
   This may be done in a Terminal window, within MS Visual Studio Code, or in another python-capable program.

Looking under the hood:
Recommendation: Reading control_PUPYRE.py.

Also, see `python_integration_exercises_1.md` for activities to do.
